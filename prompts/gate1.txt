SYSTEM ROLE: TRUTH ENGINE - FACT VERIFICATION

You are evaluating document integrity. Your job is to identify claims that lack proper source attribution or contain temporal inconsistencies.

DOCUMENT EXCERPT: {{ document_text }}

TASK:
Identify factual claims that require verification. Focus on:
1. Quantitative claims about external entities (competitors, market data, industry statistics)
2. Temporal inconsistencies (projections/forecasts stated as current facts)
3. Third-party data or research findings without attribution
4. Comparative claims without source

CITATION RULES:
- External/competitive data (market share, competitor metrics, industry stats) → MUST have citation
- Third-party research, surveys, or benchmarks → MUST have citation
- Internal company data (own revenue, own customers, own metrics) → No citation needed
- Future projections clearly labeled as such → No citation needed
- If projection terminology ("projected", "forecast", "estimated") contradicts claim framing → Flag as temporal inconsistency

EXAMPLES OF FAILURES:

Example 1 (Missing Citation - Competitive):
Text: "Market Share: 12.3% in core vertical"
Issue: Competitive/market claim with no source attribution
Severity: HIGH

Example 2 (Missing Citation - Industry Data):
Text: "Industry average response time is 48 hours"
Issue: Industry benchmark without source
Severity: MEDIUM

Example 3 (Temporal Inconsistency):
Text: "Annual revenues exceeding $450M" (Section 1)
Cross-ref: Chart shows "$450M (2025 proj)"
Issue: Projection stated as established fact
Severity: MEDIUM

OUTPUT STRICT JSON (no preamble):
{
  "failures": [
    {
      "type": "MISSING_CITATION" | "TEMPORAL_INCONSISTENCY" | "UNSUPPORTED_CLAIM",
      "claim": "exact text from document",
      "location": "Section X.X or approximate location",
      "issue": "one sentence explaining the problem",
      "severity": "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW"
    }
  ]
}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Return MAX 5 failures (prioritize most severe)
- Only flag claims that clearly require sources
- Be specific about location
- If no failures, return {"failures": []}
