EXTRACTED STRATEGIC CLAIMS FROM DOCUMENT:
{{ strategic_claims }}

TASK:
For the criterion "Strategic Feasibility", check if growth targets contradict operational constraints.

CONSTRAINT CHECKING RULES:
1. High churn rate (>15%) makes aggressive growth difficult
   - To net +X% share with Y% churn requires (X + Y)% gross growth
2. Long sales cycle (>120 days) limits acquisition velocity
3. Rising CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) makes growth expensive
4. Multiple simultaneous transformation initiatives (platform modernization + expansion + growth) creates execution risk

EXAMPLE OF FEASIBILITY FAILURE:

Document Claims:
- Target: 1.2% → 2.1% TAM share (+0.9 pts) in 3 years
- Current churn: 18% annually
- Sales cycle: 147 days vs 89 benchmark
- CAC increasing 28% YoY
- Simultaneous: Platform modernization + 3 new markets + product innovation

Analysis:
To achieve +0.9% net growth with 18% churn:
- Need 18.9% gross customer growth annually
- With 147-day sales cycle, acquisition velocity is slow
- Rising CAC makes each new customer more expensive
- Multiple initiatives split focus and resources

Verdict: QUESTIONABLE - Growth achievable IF churn/CAC fixed first, but document doesn't address these prerequisites
